# Analyzing MKT Campaings

The data is a sample of a random marketing campaing. The goal is to find interesting insights from this data in order to improve business practices and reducing risk on future promotions.

# Conclusions

1. Conversion rate: 13.92%. German has the firt place in terms of conversion rate language. On the other hand, Email has the most conversion rate.

2. Retention rate: 12.94%. Email channel has the most retention rate.

3. House ads have been underperforming due to serving all ads in English rather than each user's preferred language. There is a bug that we need to be solve this inconsistency.

4. Found that personalization was extremely effective for younger groups but less effective than the control for older groups. Younger users understand how their data might be used online and think personalization is cool while older people might feel that this is a violation of their privacy. This could be one explanation.
