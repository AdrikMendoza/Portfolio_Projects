The main purpose of this project is to communicate the finding about the data exploratory analysis, using Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the PISA 2012 dataset variables.


## Summary of Findings

**1. The top five countries with most students who participated in the study are Mexico, Italy, Spain, Canada and Brazil.**

**2. The top 5 countries with the best score are China-Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong-China, Chinese Taipei, and Korea. China-Shanghai has the best score on the three subjects. (Math Score, Reading Score, and Science Score)**

**3. There is a strong positive correlation between higest parental status and socio economic status. However, these variables do not have an impact over overall score.**

**4: All math, reading, science subjects have a positive and very strong correlation**

**5: When the parent education level is the highest. It is clear that the better is the score of a student.**

**6: There is a huge gap in parenthood type and overall scores. When both parents are present, it is clear that the score is better rather than single parenthood.**
