# MKT Analytics and Customer Segmentation - Online Retail 

In this notebook there are the following analysis:

1. `Cohort analysis`: It is a statistical technique used to analyze and compare groups of individuals who share a common characteristic over time. It is often used in business and marketing to understand customer behavior and to identify trends and patterns in how customers engage with a company or product.

2. `Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value (RFM) analysis`: It is a marketing technique that is used to identify the most valuable customers of a business. It is based on the idea that the value of a customer is determined by their recency, frequency, and monetary value.

3. `Customer Segmentation:` Clustering is a method of customer segmentation that involves grouping customers into clusters based on shared characteristics. Clustering algorithms use statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships in customer data, and to group customers into clusters based on these patterns. Now, let's find them!

# Conclusions
After making these three analysis we can conclude that:

1. `Cluster 0`: It has the profile of the Top RFM_level labeled customers as in the RFM analysis. This does make sense because top customer have the characteristics of low recency, high frequency, and high monetary value.

2. `Cluster 1`: They make sense with Low RFM_level because they have the characteristics of high recency, low frequency, and low monetary value.

3. `Cluster 2`: It make sense with Middle RFM_level, customer that have moderate recency, moderate frequency, and low monetary value.

# Recommendations

Gather data of customer demographics, in this way, maybe we can find more interesting insights in terms of customer characteristics.
